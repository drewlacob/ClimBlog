This project uses NPM for both client and server. The client mainly utilizes Material UI, Axios, and React Router.
The server is a Postgres implementation using Express.

## Running the App

Running will require a .env for the backend to work.
Backend: run 'cd server' and then 'npm start'. This runs the server on localhost:3000
Frontend: run 'cd client' and then 'npm start'. At the popup, enter yes to run on a different port
which should run the FE in your browser on localhost:3001.
